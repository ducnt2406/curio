Your job is bind a set of keywords (using their index number) that describe a bigger text to components (nodes and edges) of a trill specification. You will receive the keywords and the current trill specification with the current keywords attached.

These are the types of keywords:

- Action: can usually be mapped to a specific node or part of the dataflow. Are commonly denoted by verbs. Examples: "Load", "Visualize", "Filter", "Clean".
- Dataset: semantic references to datasets. Can be a single word or a set of words that describe the dataset. Examples: "311 requests", "Sidewalk", "Crime", "Temperature".
- Where: a geographical location of interest. Examples: "New York City", "Brazil", "Illinois", "Chicago".
- When: related to time. Examples: "over time", "on 1999", "12/06/2000", "between June and September".
- About: related to the organization of the workflow. Examples: "two scenarios", "the second part of the dataflow", "the first half of the dataflow".
- Interaction: denote interactions between nodes, with a node or with the data. Examples: "brushing", "click", "higlight", "widgets".
- Source: source of the dataset. Examples: "API", "local file", "simulation".
- Connection: describe how nodes or parts of the workflow are connected to each other. They can be explicit references to connection or implicit. Examples: "then", "after that", "second step", "connected".
- Content: references to the content of a node or part of the workflow. They can make references to a column of a dataset, machine learning models, type of visualization and so on. Examples: "column", "model".
- Metadata: information about the data like its format, number of columns, type. Examples: "2D", "3D", "JSON", "CSV".
- None: all keywords that are not of any other type.

This is the format you will receive them:

{
    "keyword0": {
      "type": "keyword1_type",
      "index": 0
    },
    "keyword1": {
      "type": "keyword1_type",
      "index": 1
    }
    ...
}

You should output the trill specification with the keywords attached following this format:

{
    "dataflow": {
        "nodes": [
            {
              "id": "node1",
              "metadata": {
                "keywords": [0,3]
              }
            },
            {
                "id": "node2",
                "metadata": {
                  "keywords": [1,2]
                }
            }
        ],
        "edges": [
            {
                "id": "reactflow__node1_node2_1",
                "metadata": {
                  "keywords": [0]
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}


For each node and edge list out the related keywords based on their index. 

**OUPUT A TRILL JSON SPECIFICATION AND NOTHING ELSE. DO NOT REMOVE OR ADD NODES OR EDGES. MAKE SURE YOU ADD THE 'dataflow' ATTRIBUTE. PAY ATTENTION TO THE 'goal' ATTRIBUTE OF EACH NODE TO HELP YOU DETERMINE WHAT KEYWORDS TO BIND. DO NOT USE THE EXAMPLE DATAFLOW. DO NOT MODIFY ANY OTHER FIELDS BESIDES 'keywords'. FOR NODES AND EDGES JUST OUTPUT 'id' and 'metadata' WITH THE 'keywords' FIELDS DO NOT OUTPUT ANYTHING ELSE.**
