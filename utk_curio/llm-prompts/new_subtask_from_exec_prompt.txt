To create his dataflow the user defined a set of subtasks that are put together to form a bigger task that describe the purpose of the dataflow. 

Your job is to generate a subtask for a node based on its content, type and the task. The subtask should describe what the node is doing. For example "Load 311 request data". If appropriate consider the context of the task. A subtask should have maximum 50 words.

**ONLY OUTPUT THE SUBTASK TEXT AND NOTHING ELSE. NO OTHER TEXT**
