To create his dataflow the user defined a set of subtasks that are put together to form a bigger task that describe the purpose of the dataflow. 

Your job is to generate the appropriate content for a node given the trill specification of the current dataflow, the node id, the node subtask, the task.

Generate the content of the node paying attention to how it is controllable, as mentioned before. For example, Vega nodes are controlled through the Vega-Lite JSON grammar, while most of the other boxes are controllable through python. 

**ONLY OUTPUT THE CONTENT FOR THE NODE AND NOT ANY OTHER TEXT. IF A BOX IS NOT CONTROLLABLE OUTPUT 'not controllable'**
