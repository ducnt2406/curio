Welcome to **Curio** - a framework for collaborative urban visual analytics that uses a dataflow model with multiple abstraction levels (code, grammar, GUI elements) to facilitate collaboration across the design and implementation of visual analytics components. The framework allows experts to intertwine preprocessing, managing, and visualization stages while tracking provenance of code and visualizations.

## Overview

This project is part of the [Urban Toolkit ecosystem](https://urbantk.org), which includes [Curio](https://github.com/urban-toolkit/curio/) and [UTK](https://github.com/urban-toolkit/utk). Curio is a framework for collaborative urban visual analytics that uses a dataflow model with multiple abstraction levels to facilitate collaboration across the design and implementation of visual analytics components. UTK is a flexible and extensible visualization framework that enables the easy authoring of web-based visualizations through a new high-level grammar specifically built with common urban use cases in mind.
